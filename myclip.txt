how to do it usign mouse scroll
ChatGPT said:
To use multi-cursor with mouse scroll in VS Code, you can combine the scroll wheel with modifier keys. Here's how:

üñ±Ô∏è Mouse Scroll + Modifier for Multi-Cursor:
‚úÖ Windows / Linux:
Hold Ctrl + Alt and scroll with the mouse wheel up or down
‚Üí This adds cursors above or below your current cursor line by line.

‚úÖ macOS:
Hold Option + Cmd and scroll with the mouse wheel
‚Üí Also adds cursors line by line above/below the current one.

üõ†Ô∏è Tip:
If this doesn‚Äôt work, make sure:

You're using a standard mouse (some trackpads may not support it).

You haven‚Äôt overridden the default keybindings.

Want to check or remap this shortcut?
Go to File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts (or Ctrl + K Ctrl + S) and search for Insert Cursor Above or Insert Cursor Below.

Would you like to remap it to something more convenient?
